## Phase 1 - Core citations (highest priority)
Use the exact NAP above. If a listing requires a street address, keep it private and set the business as a service-area business where possible.

- Google Business Profile (confirm verified + categories)
- Bing Places
- Apple Business Connect
- Yellow NZ
- Finda
- Neighbourly
- Localist
- Hotfrog NZ (if available)

## Phase 2 - Local/trade directories
Target the most relevant directories for trades, property managers, and local services.

- Wellington Chamber of Commerce / local business directories (if membership or listing exists)
- Trade-specific directories that accept service-area businesses
- Property manager supplier directories (ask for preferred supplier listing)
- Local community pages (city/region resource pages)

## Phase 3 - Backlink outreach
Aim for links from relevant local businesses and suppliers.

- Hardware suppliers: ask to be listed as an approved installer/repairer
- Property managers: request a "preferred maintenance partner" listing
- Local builders and renovation firms: co-listing or referral page
- Community groups/charities: sponsor a local event for a mention/link

## Execution checklist
- Keep NAP consistent across every listing.
- Use the same phone number and website on all listings.
- Link to service pages when the directory allows deep links.
- Add 2-3 images to each profile (from gallery).
- Update the citation tracker as each listing is submitted/verified.

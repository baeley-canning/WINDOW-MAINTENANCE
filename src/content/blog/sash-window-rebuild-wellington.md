This week we rebuilt a **badly damaged single glazed aluminium sash window** that had been thrown out by a tenant. The frame was damaged beyond a quick patch, so we sourced **obsolete aluminium parts**, colour matched them, installed **fresh hardware**, and **reglazed** the sash to get it back to a safe, clean finish.

## What we did
- Sourced obsolete aluminium sash sections to match the original profile.
- Recoloured the replacement parts to suit the existing joinery.
- Fitted new hardware including **window handles**, **window locks**, and **sash hardware** suited to older aluminium frames.
- Reglazed the sash and reinstalled it to run smoothly and lock correctly.

## Why this matters
Older aluminium joinery can still be repaired when the correct parts and processes are used. This kind of rebuild is ideal when the window is **single glazed**, the profile is **obsolete**, or the hardware is worn out. It is also a good time to replace **Yale style window handles and locks** if the original hardware is loose, corroded or mismatched.

If you have a damaged sash, stuck window, broken handle, or a window that will not lock, we can help. We service Wellington, Porirua, Lower Hutt, Upper Hutt and Kapiti.

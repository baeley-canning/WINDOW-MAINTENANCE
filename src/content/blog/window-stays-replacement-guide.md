Old or worn stays lead to windows that won’t hold position, slam shut in the wind, or won’t open fully. In many Wellington homes we see:

- Loose rivets or bent arms
- Friction worn away so windows won’t stay put
- Corroded hardware near the coast

Upgrading to modern stays improves safety and usability, and security stays restrict opening for child safety or ground-floor security.

We carry common sizes on the van and match finish to your joinery. Most stays can be swapped with minimal drilling.

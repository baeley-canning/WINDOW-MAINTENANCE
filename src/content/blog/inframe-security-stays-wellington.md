Security stays (restrictors) are one of the simplest upgrades for safer ventilation. On aluminium windows, you usually have two options: **in-frame (hidden) security stays** or **face-mounted stays**. They both limit opening for child safety and security, but they do not look the same once the job is done.

## What are in-frame (hidden) security stays?
In-frame stays sit inside the aluminium joinery. The fixings are hidden within the frame, so the hardware blends in and the window looks clean. They are a popular option for modern aluminium windows and double-glazed joinery in Wellington homes.

## Why hidden stays look better
- **Cleaner finish:** no bulky plates on the face of the frame.  
- **Hidden fixings:** the stay sits inside the joinery, not on top of it.  
- **Neater if removed later:** the holes are hidden in the frame rather than on the face.

## Face-mounted stays: when they are used
Face-mounted stays are fixed onto the face of the frame. They are sometimes the only option when the aluminium profile does not allow an in-frame stay. They work, but the visual impact is higher.

## If the stay is removed later
This is a big difference. With **in-frame stays**, any old fixing points are hidden inside the joinery. With **face-mounted stays**, the holes are visible on the face of the frame and often need to be filled or pop riveted, which can look out of place.

## Which option is right for your windows?
We check your aluminium profile and recommend the best fit. If in-frame stays are suitable, we will install them for the cleanest finish. If face-mounted stays are required, we fit them neatly and match finishes where possible.

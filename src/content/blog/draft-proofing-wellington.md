If you feel drafts or hear rattles on windy days, your glazing wedge or seals are likely tired. We commonly fix:

- Shrunken or hardened rubber wedges around glazing
- Gaps from worn latches and loose handles
- Hinges that have sagged over time

Our solutions:

- Replace wedges and seals with the correct profile
- Adjust or replace handles and latches
- Re-align sashes and replace worn hinges

Small changes make a big comfort difference, especially in Wellington’s southerly.

If your sliding door has become hard to open, it’s almost always one (or a mix) of these issues:

- Worn rollers: The most common culprit. Flat spots or seized bearings cause drag.
- Damaged track: A dented or pitted track makes even new rollers struggle.
- Misalignment: Doors can drop out of square and rub on the frame.
- Lock/keeper alignment: Latch plates out of line add resistance and poor closure.

What we do on-site:

- Replace rollers with quality parts matched to your door system.
- Reface or cap damaged tracks to give a smooth running surface.
- Re-align door panels and adjust keepers for a clean close.

Result: a smooth, quiet glide and a lock that lines up properly.

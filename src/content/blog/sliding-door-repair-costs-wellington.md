Sliding door repairs in Wellington usually come down to the same hardware: rollers, tracks, alignment and locks. Here’s what we see on-site and the pricing bands we work in.

## Common fixes and typical ranges

- **Roller replacement**: $280–$480 incl. GST per door, depending on hardware and access. Quality rollers matter — cheap ones flatten quickly.
- **Track refurbishment/caps**: $180–$320 when the track is dented or pitted. We reface or cap to give the new rollers a smooth run.
- **Alignment & clearance**: $120–$240 if the panel has dropped or is rubbing on the frame; often paired with rollers.
- **Lock/keeper adjustment or replacement**: $120–$260 depending on parts. Misaligned latches make doors feel “stiff.”
- **Leak/mitre reseal**: If water tracks under the sill, we may need a [mitre & sill reseal](/services/mitre-reseal/) to back-seal the frame correctly.

## When costs climb

- **Corroded or obsolete hardware** that must be sourced or substituted.
- **Damaged tracks beyond resurfacing** that need full replacement.
- **Water ingress from poor sealing** that requires in-frame reseal, not just rollers.

## How to keep it down

- Get the right rollers the first time; incorrect wheel size or material shortens life.
- Don’t force a dragging door — it flattens rollers and damages tracks.
- Keep weep holes clear to reduce corrosion and track staining.

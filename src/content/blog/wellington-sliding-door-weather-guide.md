Wellington weather is hard on sliding doors. Wind pressure, salt air and daily use combine to wear rollers, dent tracks and open up small leaks. Here’s what we see every week in Wellington, Porirua and the Hutt — and how we fix it so the door runs smoothly and seals properly.

## The most common Wellington failures
- **Flat or seized rollers:** Salt and grit seize bearings; doors drag and feel heavy.
- **Dented or pitted tracks:** Even new rollers struggle on a damaged track.
- **Dropped panels and poor lock alignment:** Panels settle and locks stop lining up.
- **Water tracking at the sill:** Blocked drainage or failed seal beads let water track inside.

## How we repair it (one visit where possible)
1) **Assess and strip:** Check roller condition, track damage, panel alignment and drainage.
2) **Rollers replaced:** Fit quality rollers matched to your door system.
3) **Track restored:** Reface or cap damaged tracks to give rollers a true surface.
4) **Panel and lock alignment:** Re-hang, level and set keepers so locks engage cleanly.
5) **Drainage cleared and seals checked:** Clear weep holes and reseal accessible beads to prevent water tracking.
6) **Test and tidy:** Run-test, lock-test and clean down.

## Why it matters in Wellington
- **Wind load:** Panels must be aligned and rollers true so the door closes tight against wind pressure.
- **Salt and grit:** Coastal air in Porirua and Petone accelerates bearing wear — quality rollers and clear drainage matter.
- **Water shedding:** Healthy weep paths and intact sill seals stop water tracking inside during southerlies.

## Typical outcomes
- One-hand glide, no scraping sounds
- Locks line up without force
- Water drains through weep holes, not across the sill
